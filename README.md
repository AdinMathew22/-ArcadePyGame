Two-Player Infinite Scroller Arcade Game

Project Description:
A two-player infinite scroller arcade game built using Pygame. Players navigate a scrolling ground, collect power-ups for speed boosts and temporary flying, and compete or explore within the game environment.

How to Run the Project:

Ensure Python and Pygame are installed by running py -m pip install pygame.

Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.

Run the game with python game.py.

Controls:

Player 1: Arrow keys to move, CTRL to jump.

Player 2: WASD to move, SPACE to jump.

Features Implemented:

Two-player movement with independent controls.

Infinite scrolling ground.

Power-ups: speed boost (1.5× speed for 5 seconds) and wings/flying (10 seconds).

Random power-up respawn (20–30 seconds).

Collision detection with ground and power-ups.

Planned Features:

Score tracking for each player.

Obstacles or enemies.

Sound effects.

UI elements such as timers and power-up indicators.

Learning Journal:

Learned Pygame basics including creating a game window, player movement, gravity, collisions, and drawing.

Challenges included installing Pygame (solved with py -m pip install pygame) and linking the project to GitHub using VS Code and Git Bash.

Applied learning by creating a two-player prototype with power-ups and infinite scrolling.
